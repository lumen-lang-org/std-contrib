# agents

The schema for a set of agents: what each one is, which model it runs on, which
prompt it uses, which MCP servers it may reach, and which agents it delegates
to.

Everything is a row. Nothing is compiled in, so a change through an API is
visible to the next request without a restart — which is the requirement the
rest of this follows from.

## One read gives a runnable agent

```ts
let agent: AgentView = JSON.parse<AgentView>(findById(database, agentsFull(database), "a1"));
```

```json
{"id":"a1","agentName":"lead","enabled":true,
 "prompt":{"id":"p2","promptName":"lead","version":2,"body":"You lead, briefly."},
 "config":{"id":"c1","modelId":"m1","temperature":0.2,"maxTokens":8192,"topP":0.95},
 "servers":[{"id":"s1","serverName":"filesystem","transport":"stdio","endpoint":"mcp-fs","enabled":true}],
 "subAgents":[{"id":"a2","agentName":"scout","enabled":true}]}
```

One query, not five, and no N+1: each relation is a correlated subquery the
database nests, so an agent with three servers and two sub-agents is still one
row.

## The decisions worth knowing

**A model name is a column.** `models.api_name` holds `claude-opus-5`; `label`
is what a human picks from a list. Renaming the label never changes a request,
and moving an agent to a newer model is an UPDATE.

**A prompt is versioned and never edited.** A change writes a new row with the
next version; the agent points at one. Rolling back is an UPDATE, and the
version you rolled back from is still there.

That invariant needs guarding, not just stating. `persist` is an upsert — the
right default for a mapper and the wrong one for a create — so `POST /prompts`
carrying an id that already exists used to *replace that version's text in
place* and answer as though it had made a new one, while every agent pointing
at it silently changed behaviour. Now the version and the id are both assigned
by the server, and a taken id is refused by name. The same guard is on every
create in the API: a POST that overwrites is a PUT wearing the wrong verb.

**Config is separate from the model**, because two agents on one model
routinely want different knobs. `extra` carries whatever a provider accepts
that the named columns do not, so an unfamiliar parameter needs no migration.

**Sub-agents read one level at a time.** `subAgents` names an agent's children,
not its grandchildren. A cycle in the delegation graph is therefore a row
rather than an infinite query — and the suite inserts one to prove it. What
refuses to *walk* the cycle is the run; see Delegation below.

**The schema is generated from the mappings.** `schemaPlan` builds each
`CREATE TABLE` with `createTableSql`, so the schema a program expects and the
schema a migration builds cannot drift. Only the two link tables are written by
hand, because they hold keys rather than an entity.

## Serving it

`api.ts` is the schema behind a `rest` controller:

```
GET    /agents            every agent, ordered, with ?enabled=true
GET    /agents/:id        the whole agent in one query
POST   /agents            create
PUT    /agents/:id        edit the whole row — name, description, model config,
                          prompt, enabled, default
POST   /agents/:id/servers  attach an MCP server
DELETE /agents/:id
```

Every read goes to the database. Nothing is cached and nothing is compiled in,
so a change — through this API or from anything else touching the same tables —
is visible to the very next request. That is met by not doing the thing that
would break it, rather than by machinery.

### Credentials, over the API

```
GET    /providers              which providers have a key — names only
GET    /providers/:provider    {"provider":"mistral","configured":true}
PUT    /providers/:provider/key  {"apiKey":"sk-..."} — stored encrypted
DELETE /providers/:provider/key
```

A key can be written and named; it can never be read back. Nothing in this
module returns an envelope or a plaintext, so a listing endpoint cannot leak one
by accident, and `configured` answers the only question a caller actually has.

The server refuses to start without a usable `LUMEN_MASTER_KEY`, rather than
serving with credentials it cannot open and failing every provider call later,
far from the cause.

### More than one person, if a proxy says so

There are no users here, no roles and no login. There is one column — a
thread's `owner` — and one opaque tag, which a proxy in front sets as an
`X-USER` header. Every `/threads/:id/...` route resolves the id through
`ownedThread`, the sidebar filters on `owner` in SQL, and a thread belonging to
somebody else answers **404**, the same as one that never existed.

It is off unless you say otherwise:

```sh
AGENTS_TRUST_PROXY_AUTH=on     # anything but 1/true/yes/on is off
```

Unset — the default, and what every deployment has run so far — the header is
not read at all. Not parsed, not compared. Nothing is scoped, nothing is
stamped, and the behaviour is what it was before the column existed.

Set, the header is the whole of the identity, so **`:8100` must not be
reachable by anything but that proxy**. Whoever can send an `X-USER` chooses
who they are. Firewall first; turn this on second. The tag is the `uuid` of a
JSON X-USER document if it is one, and otherwise the header verbatim — so an
nginx with basic-auth in front, setting `X-USER: alice`, is a working
multi-user deployment.

A JSON document the engine cannot read a `uuid` out of — an anonymous user, a
renamed field — is **401 at the door**, not a caller with no tag. The proxy
said it authenticated somebody it cannot name, and the only other answer would
be to guess, which used to mean handing over everything owned by nobody.

Rows written before the gate went on carry `owner = ''` and belong to nobody:
the filter is exact equality, never `'' OR tag`, because the other reading
hands the whole of the box's history to whoever authenticates first. Claiming
them is deliberate — `scenarios/backfill_owner.py`.

One exception, on purpose: `/preview/:token` is a capability. Whoever holds the
link reads that conversation's artifacts, owner or not. That is what makes a
link shareable with someone who has no account, and `POST
/threads/:id/artifacts/:slot/rotate` is how you take it back.

### The ceilings, and who may knock

Three byte caps, all of them defaulting to the number they were when they were
constants — set none of these and nothing changes:

```sh
AGENTS_ARTIFACT_BYTES_MAX=524288     # one artifact body (joule.sh runs 29360128 — see TELEGRAM-FILES.md)
AGENTS_THREAD_BYTES_MAX=104857600    # one thread's artifacts, every version
AGENTS_UPLOAD_BYTES_MAX=1048576      # one workspace file
```

The upload cap is new rather than moved: `POST /threads/:id/files` had none,
and neither did the model's own `write_file`. Both go through `putFile`, so
one number closes all three doors, `pull` from the corpus included. Anything
unreadable — `512MB`, `0`, a stray quote — is the default, because this is
read while the process starts and a typo in a unit file should not be a dead
engine. The engine enforces the same limits for everyone; per-tenant quotas
belong to a control plane, fed by `/usage` below.

```sh
AGENTS_API_TOKEN=               # unset: no token wanted, as today
```

Set, every route wants `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and answers 401 without
one — before the router matches, so an unauthorised caller cannot even map the
paths. Defense in depth and nothing more: the firewall is what isolates
`:8100`. It matters because with the trust gate on, reaching the port at all
means choosing an identity with no forgery required, and firewall-only means
one missed rule is the whole breach.

`/healthz` is the one route it never covers — a probe that needs the secret
cannot tell "the engine is down" from "the secret is wrong".

```
GET /healthz    {"version":"0.2.0","migration":"76","docker":true}
GET /usage?owner=u-alice
                {"owner":"u-alice","bytes":12288,"inputTokens":40,"outputTokens":9}
```

There is no summary `ok` in the health document. The process refuses to start
on a schema it could not migrate and refuses to start without a usable master
key, so an answer at all means the two fatal things are fine; docker being
down degrades scripts and nothing else. A boolean over facts of different
weights has to lie about one of them.

`/usage` is generic accounting — no plan, no quota, no price. Bytes are the
owner's artifact versions, exactly, from the byte column each one already
carries; workspace files are not counted, because summing them means asking
SQL for a length, which counts characters and would under-report every
non-ASCII upload. Tokens are summed from the run rows, which is why runs carry
`input_tokens` and `output_tokens` at all — every run had those numbers in
hand and dropped them. Both go out as JSON numbers straight from the
database's own sum, never parsed: an `int` here is i32, and two billion tokens
is a month.

`?owner=` is a filter and never an escalation. A scoped caller asking about a
tag it does not hold gets the same 404 a thread it does not own gets.

### Collecting abandoned opens, if you ask for it

```sh
AGENTS_SWEEP_IDLE_MS=           # unset: nothing is ever deleted
```

Nothing in this engine has ever deleted a thread row, and unset it still does
not. Set to a number of milliseconds, a background thread deletes threads older
than that which hold *nothing at all* — no turn, no artifact, no step, no
uploaded file and no run — and waits the same interval between passes. The last
two clauses are the ones an "empty means no turns" reading gets wrong: a thread
opened by dropping a file in has no turn until the first question, and a thread
whose first round failed at the provider has only its `runs` row while the
person is still looking at the error with Retry in front of them.

It is not on a request path and will not be. A read that deletes rows is, under
scoping, one person's sidebar deleting somebody else's conversations.

## Talking to what the rows describe

`mcp.ts` mounts an MCP server from its row, and `provider.ts` calls a model
from its row. Neither file names a server or a model.

```
mounting  demo-mcp at http://127.0.0.1:8200
initialize ok=true
tools     add, echo
add(2,40) 42
disabled  ok=false demo-mcp is disabled
```

```
model     Mistral Small -> mistral-small-latest
ok=true status=200
disabled  Mistral Small is disabled
```

In both, the last line is the point: `enabled` was flipped in the database and
the next call refused, with no restart.

**MCP is HTTP-transport only.** The other transport is stdio, which needs to
spawn a process, and Lumen has no subprocess API — so a stdio server has to be
fronted by something speaking HTTP. The client says exactly that rather than
failing obscurely.

## Credentials

A provider's API key is a row, encrypted:

```ts
storeCredential(db, { provider: "mistral", apiKey: "sk-...", masterKey: masterKey(), now: now });
complete(model, config, prompt, text, credentialFor(db, "mistral", masterKey()));
```

```
stored for  mistral
envelope    yV23Bn0vGDrN3+lEt04PhvRyL4jYo1JVWajaKcaW7m3J…
plaintext in the row? false
call        ok=true status=200
wrong master ok=false no API key for mistral
```

**The ciphertext is a row; the key that opens it is not.** `LUMEN_MASTER_KEY`
comes from the environment, so the database never sees it. Encrypting a
credential with a key stored beside it protects nothing. The trade is real and
intended: losing the environment loses the credentials.

AES-256-GCM, so it is authenticated — a row edited in the database refuses to
open rather than decrypting to something plausible that would then be sent to a
provider. A test does exactly that edit.

**Every failure to open answers the same way**: absent, wrong master key, and
tampered all return `""`. A caller that could tell them apart could use this
table to test master keys against.

An empty key is refused at the door, because an empty plaintext encrypts to a
valid envelope that decrypts to `""` — indistinguishable from a failure.

`providersWithCredentials` returns names only; nothing in this module returns an
envelope, so a listing endpoint cannot leak one by accident.

## Running an agent

```ts
let answer = runAgent(db, "a1", "What is 2 plus 40?", masterKey());
answer.text            // "42"
answer.promptVersion   // which prompt actually served it
answer.modelApiName    // which model actually served it
```

```
agent=calculator prompt=v1 model=mistral-small-latest
ok=true status=200
reply 42

after UPDATE: prompt=v2 ok=true
disabled -> calculator is disabled
```

The prompt, the model, its wire name, the temperature and the key are all rows.
Rolling a prompt back or moving an agent to another model is an UPDATE, and it
takes effect on the next call.

Each row is read on its own rather than through `agentsFull`. A relation that
matches nothing is `null`, and a run needs its prompt, config and model to
exist — so a dangling reference is named rather than turned into a parse
failure against a type that declares them present.

The run reports which prompt version and model answered, so a caller records
what happened rather than what it assumed would.

## Calling tools

An agent reaches an MCP server because a row links the two. That link is all it
takes — the tools are fetched from the server on each run, described to the
model in its own format, called, and their results fed back until the model
stops asking.

```
mounted   2 tools from 1 server(s)
  - warehouse_stock: How many units of a part are in a named warehouse.
  - part_price: The unit price of a part in euros.

user      We need 40 units of A-114. Is there enough in Rotterdam, and what
          would 40 cost?

-- what the model did (context) --------------------------------
0 ok  parts.warehouse_stock {"part": "A-114", "warehouse": "Rotterdam"}
      -> 37 units of A-114 in Rotterdam.
1 ok  parts.part_price {"part": "A-114"}
      -> A-114 costs EUR 12.50 per unit.
rounds    2, stopped: final

-- what the user sees (conversation) ---------------------------
agent     There are 37 units of A-114 in Rotterdam, so you're short by 3.
          The cost for 40 units would be EUR 500.00 (40 × €12.50).
```

`examples/run-with-tools.ts`, against a live model and a live MCP server.
Nothing in it names a tool: `INSERT INTO agent_mcp_servers` is what gave the
agent both of them.

**A run has two kinds of state and they are different things.** The *context*
is everything the model was shown — every turn, every call, every result. The
*conversation* is what a person reads. Neither is a filter of the other: the
context holds a tool's four thousand lines of output that nobody wants to read,
and a transcript holds nothing about the six calls behind one sentence.
`AgentRun` carries both, separately, and `text` is the only field meant for
display.

**Tool results are asked for, not cached.** Each run asks every linked server
what it offers. That is a round trip per server per run, and it is deliberate:
a cached list is a list that is wrong the first time somebody deploys a tool.

**What could not be mounted is reported, never silent.** A disabled server, a
stdio one, an unreachable one — the agent still answers, and `notes` says what
it answered without. A tool the model was never told about is a failure that
looks exactly like a bad answer.

**A failed tool call goes back to the model, not to the caller.** A tool that
reports an error, or a name the model invented, comes back as a result it can
act on. Stopping the run instead would turn a recoverable mistake into a dead
one.

**The step budget bounds calls, not just rounds.** One reply can ask for an
unbounded number of calls, so both are counted against the same budget.

Three formats, not one abstraction: OpenAI and Mistral wrap a tool in a
`function` object and send arguments as a string holding JSON; Anthropic names
the schema `input_schema`, carries calls as content blocks, and needs every
result of one turn inside a single user message. Those are the differences, and
`wire.test.ts` is the record of them.

## Delegation

An agent's children are tools too. A parent that can ask a specialist is the
same shape as a parent that can read a file — a name, a description of when to
use it, one argument — so one loop, one trace and one budget cover both.

```
user      Can we ship 40 units of A-114 from Rotterdam today, and what is the bill?

0 ok  parts-desk.ask_parts-desk {"question":"What is the price and stock level
                                 of part A-114 in Rotterdam?"}
      -> A-114 costs €12.50 per unit, and there are 37 units in Rotterdam.
1 ok  parts-desk.ask_parts-desk {"question":"Can we ship 40 units of A-114
                                 from Rotterdam today?"}
      -> No, only 37 units are available in Rotterdam.

lead      We cannot ship 40 units today, as only 37 are in stock; the bill for
          37 would be €462.50.
```

`examples/delegate.ts`. The lead reaches no MCP server at all — two rows give
it everything: one links the desk to the parts server, one makes the desk the
lead's child.

**A child is a separate run.** It has its own prompt, its own model, its own
tools and its own context. It cannot see the parent's conversation, which is
why the argument's description insists the question repeat every name it
depends on. That is not a style note: asked *"stock of A-114?"* with Rotterdam
left out, a child picked a warehouse, its lookup failed, and it answered "no
stock" — which the parent passed on as fact. The wording that stops it is in
`delegateSchema`, and the reason is in the comment beside it.

**A cycle is refused by name, not by the depth limit.** `agent_sub_agents`
accepts a cycle deliberately — the schema suite inserts one — so a run also
refuses to enter an agent already on its path. Stopping three levels down
would report the wrong cause.

**Past the depth limit an agent runs alone**, rather than not at all. Refusing
the whole run because a child was out of reach turns a bounded plan into no
answer.

**What went wrong below surfaces above.** A child's own notes are re-reported
under its name, and a child that answered *after* its tool calls failed is
recorded as such — in the notes, never in the result, because the result goes
to the model and a warning it can quote is a warning that reaches the user as
an answer.

## Evaluations

Cases live in a Langfuse dataset, so the people who write them do not need a
programmer. Running them is a request, not a deployment — the agent, its
sub-agents, its tools and the judge are all rows.

```ts
let out = runEvals(db, {
  agentId: "a1",
  judgeAgentId: "judge1",
  dataset: "parts-desk-evals",
  runName: "nightly",
  master: master,
  maxItems: 50,
}, tracerFor(db, master));
```

A case says what to ask, what a good answer looks like, and — when it cares —
the route the run should take:

```json
{"input":  {"question": "Can we ship 40 units of A-114 from Rotterdam today?"},
 "expectedOutput": {"answer": "No — only 37 units are in stock in Rotterdam.",
                    "tools":  ["warehouse_stock", "part_price"],
                    "agents": ["parts-desk"]}}
```

**The route is scored separately from the answer**, and that is the point:

```
PASS  answer 1  tools 0.5  agents 1   Can we ship 40 units of A-114 today?
      route   : tools [warehouse_stock]  agents [parts-desk]
      MISSING tools : part_price
```

The answer was right and the run never called `part_price`, so it had no basis
for the bill it quoted. An outcome-only suite records that as a clean pass and
finds out when the prices change. The mirror case is an agent that answers a
stock question from its own head — `agents 0`, no delegation — which reads as
a good answer until the stock moves.

So `tool-use` and `delegation` go to Langfuse as their own scores beside
`correctness`. Averaging them into one number would hide both failures.

**What was reached is collected from the whole tree.** `AgentRun.steps` holds
only what *that* agent did; a tool called inside a sub-agent appears nowhere in
it. `calledTools` and `calledAgents` accumulate through the delegations,
because "did this run reach the stock tool" is a question about the tree and
not about the top of it.

**A case that names no route cannot fail one** — it scores 1, rather than being
dragged to zero by a check it never asked for.

**The judge is an agent**, so which model judges and how strictly are rows.
With none configured, a built-in judge compares the numbers in the reference
against the answer and says that is what it did; a suite that refuses to run
until someone sets up a judge is a suite nobody sets up a judge for. A judge
that *was* configured and failed to run is reported rather than fallen back
from — those are different problems, and grading anyway would hide one. A judge
answering in prose has not judged, which is not the same as scoring zero.

**The backend is a row, not an assumption.** `trace_config.backend` names it —
`langfuse`, `otlp`, `braintrust`, `langsmith`, `phoenix`, `arize` — and the
tracing package turns that name into how a request authenticates, which extra
headers it wants, which attribute scheme it reads, and which encoding it takes.

Researching five vendors changed the design twice. One extra header was not
enough: Arize AX wants `space_id` and `api_key` together, so extras are a list.
And an attribute *prefix* was the wrong abstraction entirely — OpenInference
names things by meaning, not by vendor (`openinference.span.kind`,
`input.value`, `llm.model_name`), which no prefix substitution reaches. What
varies is the whole scheme.

Sending to a real Phoenix then found a third thing, which no amount of reading
had: it answers `415 Unsupported content type: application/json`. OTLP defines
a JSON mapping and a protobuf one, and a receiver may implement either. This
package writes JSON, so a protobuf-only backend is refused before the request
is made rather than after someone else's server rejects it. Against a plain OpenTelemetry collector the same run
produces the same 15-span tree with the standard `gen_ai.*` attributes and no
`langfuse.*` at all; against Langfuse it carries both. Datasets are the one
thing that does not generalise — they are not an OpenTelemetry concept, so a
backend either has an API for them or says it has none, and evaluations report
that rather than building a URL that 404s.

Langfuse's own LLM-as-a-judge can run alongside this one: it scores server-side
on new dataset runs, needs an LLM connection configured in Langfuse, and in
v3.224 its evaluator config has no public API. Both scores then sit on the same
trace, and they do disagree at the margins — which is an argument for keeping
both rather than trusting either alone.

## Retrieval

Documents live in folders and an agent reads the folders it is granted.

```
uploaded  /engineering/plume  chunks=1
uploaded  /hr/policies        chunks=1

engineer granted /engineering
people   granted /hr

-- eng: How many days of annual leave do we get?
   read  /engineering/plume/plume_relations  distance 0.377
   said  Your documents do not cover it.

-- hr:  How many days of annual leave do we get?
   read  /hr/policies/leave_policy  distance 0.147
   said  You get 28 days of annual leave, including public holidays.
```

`examples/scoped-rag.ts`, against PostgreSQL. One table, one embedding model,
one question — and the engineer cannot see the HR document. The isolation is
the `agent_scopes` rows, not separate corpora, which is what makes it survive
somebody adding a folder.

That was a disclosure before scopes existed: `retrieve` filtered on `model_id`
alone, so any two agents sharing an embedding model read each other's
documents. A demo with one corpus never shows it.

**Scopes match on segment boundaries.** `/specs` covers `/specs/plume` and must
not cover `/specifications`. A string prefix would hand a folder to anyone
granted a name that starts the same way.

**An empty grant reads nothing**, never everything. The alternative makes
revoking an agent's access the most destructive edit available, and the failure
looks like the system working.

**Retrieval happens in the run**, not in the caller. It was a thing you did
before calling `runAgent`, which meant an agent's knowledge lived in whoever
remembered to fetch it — two callers of the same agent got different
behaviour. Now `agent_scopes` says what it may read and `agent_retrieval` says
how.

**Every way it can come up short is in `notes`** — not PostgreSQL, switched
off, no embedding model, no scopes, no credential, nothing close enough. An
agent that answered without its documents looks exactly like one that answered
from them.

### Retrieval, the older way


pgvector, so PostgreSQL only — SQLite and MySQL have no vector type. An agent
runs anywhere; it retrieves against Postgres.

```ts
let width = embedText(embedModel, "probe", key).dimensions;   // ask the model
createDocuments(db, width);
indexDocument(db, embedModel, {
  id: "d1", source: "plume", scope: "/specs/plume",
  body: "Plume maps records to tables…",
}, key);

let found = retrieve(db, embedModel, ["/specs/plume"], "Why is an unordered page refused?", 2, key);
runAgent(db, "a1", asContext(found.found) + "\nQuestion: " + question, masterKey());
```

```
embedding width 1024
indexed 3 documents

retrieved plume/d2  distance 0.19052260549339184
retrieved plume/d1  distance 0.23477740073896414

Plume refuses an unordered page because two requests for the first twenty rows
can overlap or skip records when the database answers in any order.
```

The embedding model is a row like every other. `models` carries `kind` —
`"chat"` or `"embedding"` — and `dimensions`, the width of the vectors it
produces. Pointing a corpus at a different embedding model is an INSERT and an
UPDATE, not an edit to any file.

That makes three things checkable that were not:

- **A chat model cannot embed.** A provider offers both and they answer
  different endpoints; refusing here beats a 404 from the provider.
- **A corpus needs a width.** `createDocuments` refuses a model that does not
  say how wide its vectors are, rather than creating a column of some default.
- **A search only sees its own model's chunks.** `documents.model_id` records
  which model embedded each one, and `retrieve` filters on it. Two models'
  vectors sit at the same width and are not comparable; mixing them returns
  confident nonsense rather than an error.

And what the model says it produces is checked against what it returned, so a
mismatch is a sentence rather than a wire error about column widths.

The query vector is bound, not interpolated: it came from a provider's reply
and is data like any other. `distance` is returned so a caller can decide what
is too far, rather than trusting the ranking blindly.

The live halves are `examples/mount-mcp.ts`, `examples/call-model.ts` and
`examples/run-with-tools.ts`. A test that needs a credential or a listening port
is a test that gets skipped, so those stay examples and the refusals stay tests.

Requires `sh ../plume/build.sh` first.

## The console

A web frontend for this package lives in `app/`: a Lit element built on
[LumenUI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nuraly/lumenui)'s `<nr-chatbot>`,
served by [LumenJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nuraly/lumenjs), talking to
the API above through one origin. The console is its own server, so `/api` and
`/preview` are forwarded by the app rather than by an nginx in front of it —
one place those rules live, in `app/server/api-proxy.ts`.

Run everything — database, API, indexer, console — with one command:

```sh
cd packages/agents
cp .env.example .env      # set LUMEN_MASTER_KEY (openssl rand -hex 16)
cd app
docker compose up --build
```

Console on `http://localhost:8080`, the API behind it on `/api`, PostgreSQL
with pgvector underneath so documents and retrieval work. It publishes to
loopback: nobody signs in to this deployment, so whoever reaches the port is
the operator. `app/compose.yaml` says what to change to expose it, and what to
put in front of it when you do.

One image, `ghcr.io/nuralyio/agents-console`, serves every deployment. The
`AUTH` variable is read once at boot and chooses between three: `none` is the
box above; `builtin` gives the console its own sign-in and its own user store;
`proxy` trusts an `X-USER` set by an authenticating gateway in front. Nothing
under `app/src/` knows which one it is running under — see `app/CLAUDE.md`,
and `GATEWAY.md` for the hosted arrangement.

The console has a chat surface per conversation, a workspace panel over the
thread's files, a **Knowledge** page — folder rail, the folder's sources, and
upload, where typing a new path *is* how a folder is created, since a scope
exists by carrying documents — and a settings overlay reached from the account
block: agents (an edit form per agent), models, prompt versions, MCP servers,
provider keys and tracing.

### One PUT per resource

A row is edited by sending the row. There is no route per attribute: the rules
that must hold — exactly one default agent, exactly one enabled embedding
model — live in the row's own PUT, so they hold whichever way the row is
written. A rule enforced at one door and not another is not enforced.

```
PUT  /agents/:id          the whole agent row
PUT  /models/:id          the whole model row
PUT  /servers/:id         the whole MCP server row
```

What is *not* an attribute keeps its own route: `POST /models/:id/test` calls
the model and reports what happened; `PUT /servers/:id/auth` carries a token
that never becomes a column, since it goes to the encrypted store; the link
collections (`/servers`, `/sub-agents`, `/scopes`) add and remove
relationships, which a row cannot express; and `/retrieval` is its own record.

### Indexing is a queue

Uploading a document writes a job and answers `202` — the work is taken, not
done. A worker drains the queue: `agents-indexer`, its own process in the
compose file, because embedding a corpus is one model call per chunk and must
not compete with serving requests. Two workers can run against one database;
the claim is a single `UPDATE … FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, so they never take the
same job.

The queue is a table rather than a broker. PostgreSQL is already required for
documents, so a job table adds no service — and the rows are the journal the
console renders, which a broker would not keep. `GET /jobs` is that journal;
`GET /documents?scope=` puts queued and failed rows above the indexed ones, so
a file you just dropped is visible instead of looking lost.

### End-to-end tests

`app/e2e` drives the console with Playwright against a live API — it starts no
fake, because a suite checking its own fake is checking its own fake:

```sh
cd packages/agents/app
npx playwright test              # needs the API and `npm run dev` running
```

The knowledge specs skip themselves when the API is on sqlite: it answers
"documents need PostgreSQL (pgvector)", and reporting correct behaviour as a
failure teaches people to ignore the suite.

For development against a locally running API:

```sh
cd packages/agents/app
npm install
npm run dev               # http://localhost:5173, /api proxied to :8100
```

The app is plain npm/TypeScript and is not part of the URL-import catalog;
CI's `packages/*/*.ts` glob is one level deep on purpose, so the TypeScript
here is never handed to the Lumen compiler. Keep it that way — both languages
use `.ts`.
